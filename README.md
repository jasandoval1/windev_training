## Windows Developer Training Outline

This repository contains an outline a training curriculum designed to develop (pun intended) aspiring Windows developers.

The outline provided herein assumes the following background knowledge and skills:
- Working proficiency in the C programming language
- Operating system concepts including:
    - Virtual memory, paging, and address translation
    - Processes and threads
    - CPU scheduling
    - The distinction between user-mode and kernel-mode
    - Filesystems

The training curriculum is organized as a logical progression of topics relevant to Windows development - the material included in module N assumes mastery of the material presented in module N-1. That said, if you are coming to this repository with some degree of background in development on the Windows platform, you may feel comfortable skipping some number of modules. 

Each module is partitioned into one or more training items. Each of these training items is composed of relevant reading material and, where applicable, one or more programming exercises or "experiments" designed to reinforce the concepts presented in the reading.

Happy hacking.
