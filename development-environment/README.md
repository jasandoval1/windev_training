### Checks on Learning

- What is the purpose of the distinction between Visual Studio Solutions and Visual Studio Projects?
- Visual Studio is not magic - under the hood, it simply invokes the MSVC compiler (`cl.exe`) and linker (`link.exe`) to build native projects. How do you view the complete command line that Visual Studio is using to build your application? 
- Within Visual Studio, where is one able to modify the following build configuration options:
    - `#include` directories
    - Linker input directories
    - Linker input files
- What is the purpose of precompiled headers? How do you set up a project to make use of precompiled headers?
- What are the different variants of the Microsoft Visual C/C++ Runtime Library against which you can link your applications? When are each of these different variants appropriate?
- The Windows SDK and Windows Store provide a number of symbolic debuggers - WinDbg, WinDbg Preview, `cdb.exe`, etc. How are these tools similar? How are they different?
