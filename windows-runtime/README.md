## The Component Object Model and The Windows Runtime

This module provides a (brief) introduction to the component object model (COM) and the Windows runtime API. While COM may appear to be merely an archaic, overly-verbose programming model which is now rarely used (which is true to a certain extent), Microsoft has chosen to implement the Windows Runtime on top of the fundamental concepts upon which COM is built. The Windows Runtime is an important technology in that it is the mechanism by which Microsoft will expose new operating system functionality to user-mode applications going forward.
