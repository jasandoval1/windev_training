## Network Programming on Windows

This module covers the essentials of Windows networking infrastructure and the networking API available on Windows. Ostensibly, this is a relatively large topic composed of many possible sub-topics; for the purposes of this curriculum, the focus will be on the basic networking API exposed via the Windows Sockets API (_WinSock2_).

### Reading Material
