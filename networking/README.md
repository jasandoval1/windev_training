## Network Programming on Windows

This module covers the essentials of Windows networking infrastructure and the networking API available on Windows. Ostensibly, this is a relatively large topic composed of many possible sub-topics; for the purposes of this curriculum, the focus will be on the basic networking API exposed via the Windows Sockets API (_WinSock2_).

### Reading Material

- _Windows System Programming, Fourth Edition_: Pages 411-452
    - This section introduces most of the essentials of the Windows sockets API and, importantly, compares and contrasts the networking API exposed by Win32 with the BSD socket API with which may developers are likely more familiar.
