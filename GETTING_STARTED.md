## Getting Started

This brief guide will walk you through creating a fork of this project so that you may work locally with all of the training materials while retaining the ability to pull in new updates to the curriculum.

### Initial Configuration

Navigate to the repository overview page for the `windows_developer_training` project. At the top of the page, select the `fork` option to create a new fork of the repository.

Once you have successfully created your fork of the project, grab a local clone of the repository.

```
> git clone https://git.cybbh.space/path/to/your/fork/windows_developer_training.git Local
```

Change directories into your local clone of the fork. You can verify that, currently, the only remote set for your clone is the fork you just created:

```
> git remote -v
origin  https://git.cybbh.space/path/to/your/fork/windows_developer_training.git (fetch)
origin  https://git.cybbh.space/path/to/your/fork/windows_developer_training.git (push)
```

Now add the original `windows_developer_training` repository as a second remote with the identifier `upstream`:

```
> git remote add upstream https://git.cybbh.space/csd-g/members/projects/windows_developer_training.git
```

Verify that the new remote was added successfully:

```
> git remote -v
origin  https://git.cybbh.space/path/to/your/fork/windows_developer_training.git (fetch)
origin  https://git.cybbh.space/path/to/your/fork/windows_developer_training.git (push)
upstream        https://git.cybbh.space/csd-g/members/projects/windows_developer_training.git (fetch)
upstream        https://git.cybbh.space/csd-g/members/projects/windows_developer_training.git (push)
```

### Pushing Work to Your Fork

Because you cloned your local repository from the forked remote, your default remote is automatically set to the `master` branch on this remote repository (named, by default, `origin`). Therefore, no additional configuration is required to ensure that your local updates are pushed to the correct remote; a simple 

```
> git push
```

will work correctly by default.

### Pulling in Updates

To pull in updates to the training material itself from the original repository, first `fetch` the `master` branch from your `upstream` remote configured above:

```
> git fetch upstream
c:\Dev\Test>git fetch upstream
From https://git.cybbh.space/csd-g/members/projects/windows_developer_training
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
```

The `master` branch of the original `windows_developer_training` repository is fetched locally as the branch `upstream/master`.

Now checkout the branch of your fork that you want to merge the updates into. For instance, the `master` branch:

```
> git checkout master
```

And finally, merge the updates into your fork's branch:

```
> git merge upstream/master
```

This synchronizes your local fork with the original `windows_developer_training` project. The next time you push to your fork's remote repository, the updates will also be reflected there.
